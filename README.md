# ✋ Task 4: Hand Gesture Recognition (CNN)

*Prodigy Infotech Internship - Machine Learning Track*

### 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a *Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)* to identify and classify hand gestures from images. 

While the original task description mentions the LeapGestRecog dataset, this implementation uses the *Rock-Paper-Scissors* dataset from TensorFlow. This dataset serves as a standard, lightweight alternative that allows for efficient training of deep learning models in cloud environments like Google Colab without the overhead of processing 2GB+ of raw data.

### 📊 Model Output
The model was trained for 10 epochs. The graphs below show the training progress, achieving high accuracy on both training and validation sets.
